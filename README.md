Exercises: JSON Processing
This document defines the exercise assignments for the “Spring Data” course @ SoftUni.

1.	Products Shop	

A products shop holds users, products and categories for the products. Users can sell and buy products.
•	Users have an id, first name (optional) and last name (at least 3 characters) and age (optional).
•	Products have an id, name (at least 3 characters), price, buyerId (optional) and sellerId as IDs of users.
•	Categories have an id and name (from 3 to 15 characters)
Using Code First approach create a database following the above description.
 
Configure the following relations in your models:

•	Users should have many products sold and many products bought. 
•	Products should have many categories.
•	Categories should have many products.
•	Users should have many friends (i.e. users).


2.	Seed the Database

Import the data from the provided files (users.json, products.json, categories.json).
Import the users first. When importing the products, randomly select the buyer and seller from the existing users. Leave out some products that have not been sold (i.e. buyer is null).
Randomly generate categories for each product from the existing categories.


3.	Query and Export Data

Write the below described queries and export the returned data to the specified format. 
Query 1 – Products in Range
Get all products in a specified price range (e.g. 500 to 1000), which have no buyer. Order them by price (from lowest to highest). Select only the product name, price and the full name of the seller. Export the result to JSON.
products-in-range.json
[
  {
    "name": "TRAMADOL HYDROCHLORIDE",
    "price": 516.48,
    "seller": "Christine Gomez"
  },

  },
  ...
]

Query 2 – Successfully Sold Products

Get all users who have at least 1 item sold with a buyer. Order them by last name, then by first name. Select the person's first and last name. For each of the products sold (products with buyers), select the product's name, price and the buyer's first and last name. 
users-sold-products.json
[

    ]
  },
  ...
]

Query 3 – Categories by Products Count

Get all categories. Order them by the number of products in each category (a product can be in many categories). For each category select its name, the number of products, the average price of those products and the total revenue (total price sum) of those products (regardless if they have a buyer or not).

[
  {
    "category": "Sports",
    "productsCount": 49,
    "averagePrice": 754.327755,
    "totalRevenue": 36962.06

  },
  ...
]

Query 4 – Users and Products

Get all users who have at least 1 product sold. Order them by the number of products sold (from highest to lowest), then by last name (ascending). Select only their first and last name, age and for each product - name and price.
Export the results to JSON. Follow the format below to better understand how to structure your data.

4.	Car Dealer

A car dealer needs information about cars, their parts, parts suppliers, customers and sales. 
•	Cars have make, model, and travelled distance in kilometers.
•	Parts have name, price and quantity.
•	Part supplier have name and info whether he uses imported parts.
•	Customer has name, date of birth and info whether he/she is a young driver (Young driver is a driver that has less than 2 years of experience. Those customers get additional 5% off for the sale.).
•	Sale has car, customer and discount percentage.
A price of a car is formed by the total price of its parts.
Using Code First approach create a database following the above description.
 
Configure the following relations in your models:

•	A car has many parts and one part can be placed in many cars
•	One supplier can supply many parts and each part can be delivered by only one supplier
•	In one sale, only one car can be sold
•	Each sale has one customer and a customer can buy many cars

5.	Car Dealer Import Data

Import data from the provided files (suppliers.json, parts.json, cars.json, customers.json).
First import the suppliers. When importing the parts, set to each part a random supplier from the already imported suppliers. Then, when importing the cars add between 10 and 20 random parts to each car. Then import all customers. Finally, import the sales records by randomly selecting a car, customer and the amount of discount to be applied (discounts can be 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, 40% or 50%).
6.	Car Dealer Query and Export Data
Write the below described queries and export the returned data to the specified format.
